	// Place your snippets for typescriptreact here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"import": {
		"prefix": "imp",
		"body": [
			"import $2 from '$1';",
		],
		"description": "Import statement"
	},
	"import_destructor": {
		"prefix": "imd",
		"body": [
			"import { $2 } from '$1';",
		],
		"description": "Import statement"
	},
	"Print to console": {
		"prefix": "clg",
		"body": [
			"console.log('$1');",
		],
		"description": "Log output to console"
	},
	"Type GraphQL Resolver": {
		"prefix": "resolver",
		"body": [
		  "import { Resolver } from \"type-graphql\";",
		  "",
		  "@Resolver()",
		  "export class $1Resolver {",
		  "  @$2()",
		  "  async $3() {}",
